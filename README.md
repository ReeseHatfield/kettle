# kettle
A simple and elegant set of java build tools


## WIP

This project is currently a work in progress. Currently, you are able to init a new project, run a project, and manage dependencies

In the future, there will at minimum be support for building JAR files, as well as javadoc generation.

## Usage:
Currently, you will need to run the `./build.sh` file to get a binary executable. The first time you run this, it will 
take a very long time, as it will compile all of NodeJS into this binary. Afterwards, you can all the `kettle` executable to your path
and use it as described. (Those docs are also a WIP).
